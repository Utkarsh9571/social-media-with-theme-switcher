## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### What I learned

I tried a different way to toggle the theme, probably not the ideal way to do it, but i thought about it and i want to try that way, it almost works and by trying that way i get to know that we can't change the colors of text by toggling and in-built js property, like we do for(background Color), so for that i need to do that bt the way i did last time by adding different classes for different theme, and toggling them in js.

i knew i can complete this challenge without much problem like the last one and i needed a win and i got one.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
